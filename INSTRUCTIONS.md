## OVERVIEW 

Using the provided data (tickets.json and users.json and organization.json) write a simple command line application (or a locally runnable web-app) to search the data and return the results in a human readable format. 

When executing a search operation, where data exists, values from any related entities should be included in the results. The user should be able to search on any field and exact value matching is fine (e.g. “mar” won’t return “mary”). The user should also be able to search for empty values, e.g. where description is empty. 

Search can get pretty complicated pretty easily, we just want to see that you can code a basic search application. 

## EVALUATION CRITERIA 
We will look at your project and assess it for: 
    1. Does It Work - Does the solution run per the instructions? 
    2. Design - Does the solution demonstrate good modularity, extensibility, and separation of concerns? Are appropriate OOP/OOD principles employed? 
    3. Readability - Does the solution display proficiency with the language, a consistent style, and is it understandable? Hint: Use of your favorite linter or static analysis tool highly encouraged! 
    4. Testing - Do the tests pass, do they verify all the use cases, are they structured well, do they break when unexpected changes are made? 
    5. Robustness - Does the solution work quickly, efficiently, and gracefully handle unexpected situations? 
If you have any questions about this criteria please ask. 

## SPECIFICATIONS 
    • Use the language in which you are strongest. 
    • Feel free to use libraries or roll your own code as you see fit. 
    • Include a README with (accurate) usage instructions.
